# Swarm-Formation

**Swarm-Formation** is a distributed swarm trajectory optimization framwork for formation flight in dense environments.
- A differentiable graph-theory-based cost function that effectively describes the interaction topology of robots and quantifies the similarity distance between three-dimensional formations.
- A spatial-temporal optimization framework with a joint cost function that takes formation similarity, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic feasibility into account, which makes the swarm robots has the ability to balance moving in formation while avoiding obstacles.


# Updates
- **April 12, 2022** - A distributed swarm formation optizamition framework is released. An example of normal hexagon formation navigation in random forest map is given.
- **Plan** - A more general pipeline for swarm formation navigation in dense environment is on the way.
